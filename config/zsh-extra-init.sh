	# Any parameter that is set to the absolute name of a directory immediately
	# becomes a name for that directory, that will be used by the ‘%~’ and related

	# If this is set, zsh sessions will append their history list to the history
	# file, rather than replace it. Thus, multiple parallel zsh sessions will all
	# have the new entries from their history lists added to the history file, in

	# trim it when the number of lines grows 20% beyond the value specified by
	# $SAVEHIST (see also the HIST_SAVE_BY_COPY option).

	# setting this option will cause the oldest history event that has a duplicate
	# to be lost before losing a unique event from the list. You should be sure to

	# behaviour. Note that the command lingers in the internal history until the
	# next command is entered before it vanishes, allowing you to briefly reuse or
	# edit the line. If you want to make it vanish right away without entering
	# another command, type a space and press return.

	# added to the $HISTFILE incrementally (as soon as they are entered), rather
	# than waiting until the shell exits. The file will still be periodically

	# On an ambiguous completion, instead of listing possibilities or beeping,
	# insert the first match immediately. Then when completion is requested again,
	# remove the first match and insert the second match, etc. When there are no

	# used to loop through the list in the other direction. This option overrides

	# This option both imports new commands from the history file, and also causes
	# your typed commands to be appended to the history file (the latter is like
	# specifying INC_APPEND_HISTORY, which should be turned off if this option is
	# in effect). The history lines are also output with timestamps ala
	# EXTENDED_HISTORY (which makes it easier to find the spot where we left off
	# reading the file after it gets re-written).
	#
	# By default, history movement commands visit the imported lines as well as the
	# local lines, but you can toggle this on and off with the set-local-history
	# zle binding. It is also possible to create a zle widget that will make some
	# commands ignore imported commands, and some include them.
	#
	# If you find that you want more control over when commands get imported, you
	# may wish to turn SHARE_HISTORY off, INC_APPEND_HISTORY or
	# INC_APPEND_HISTORY_TIME (see above) on, and then manually import commands
	# whenever you need them using ‘fc -RI’.
	setopt sharehistory

	# Use the zsh line editor. Set by default in interactive shells connected to a
